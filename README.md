# pythonWordle
Wordle in python

## Installing
To install any python packages that are needed, run `install.bat`. It will install the random2 package and the colorama package

Alternatively, you can run these commands in your terminal to get the necessary libraries:

`pip install colorama`

`pip install random2`

## Running the Program
To run the program, run `run.bat`. Running the python file itself will not stop the window from closing after completing the game and will always close if an error message pops up
